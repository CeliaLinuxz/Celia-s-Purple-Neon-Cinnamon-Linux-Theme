# Celia-s-Purple-Neon-Cinnamon-Linux-Theme


This is my first Cinnamon Theme for Linux,  this is to be used on the Cinamon Desktop Environment

Put it as a folder after you unzipped it in  /yourusername/.themes/

Unfortunately this will only work if you have the cinnamon desktop environment running.

Open up  themes app and switch to this afterward, you're free to use this wallpaper.
